# WebCrawlerPlus


WebCrawlerPlus is a Python-based project that combines web scraping, automation, and data processing. It provides a set of tools and utilities to crawl websites, extract data, and automate repetitive tasks. The project aims to simplify the process of building web crawlers and automating web-related workflows.

## Features

- Web scraping: Extract data from websites using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.
- Automation: Automate web interactions, such as form filling, clicking, and scrolling, using the pyautogui library.
- Data processing: Perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on the extracted data.
- Easy-to-use: The project provides a simple and intuitive API for configuring and running web crawlers and automation tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/liziling2018/WebCrawlerPlus.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Configure the web crawler by editing the `config.py` file. Specify the target website URL, the data to extract, and any additional settings.

2. Run the web crawler:

python crawler.py


The crawler will start visiting the specified website, extract the desired data, and store it in a CSV file.

3. For automation tasks, create a new Python script and import the `automation` module. Use the provided functions to automate web interactions.

```python
from automation import click, fill_form, scroll

# Example: Automate form filling
fill_form('https://www.example.com/form', {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})

# Example: Automate clicking on a button
click('https://www.example.com/button')

# Example: Automate scrolling down the page
scroll('https://www.example.com/page', 3)  # Scroll 3 times
